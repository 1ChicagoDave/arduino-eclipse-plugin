this repository contains all the code that is needed to create a plugin for eclipse that makes it easier to create arduino sketches in eclipse.

to install the plugin use the update site http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/update site/
For usage instructions see

More info on the plugin

This plugin is based on avr-eclipse plugin. It extends it so that the arduino settings are set easily. Appart from importing arduino code it does not extend the avr-eclipse functionality but sets it correctly for arduino in a arduino way. For instance selecting a arduino board sets the avr-eclipse MCU name, MCU frequency and AVR dude upload speed.

Unfortunately I had to refactor the avr-eclipse code from de.innot to it.baeyens. I hope to be able to undo this one day.
Following is a list of repositories with some quick explenation
it.baeyens.arduino (a feature project)
it.baeyens.arduino.eclipse (the basic core fucntionality)
it.baeyens.arduino.eclipse.globals (global variables; should have been part of the above project)
it.baeyens.avreclipse* (refactored de.innot.avreclipse* packages)
