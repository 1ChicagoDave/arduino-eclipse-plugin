		<h2>How can I contact the author of this great plugin</h2>
		You can reach the author at <a href="mailto:eclipse@baeyens.it">eclipse@baeyens.it</a>.
		If you have a question please follow the <a	href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">eclipse guidance when formulating your question</a>	<br>
note the eclipse link is not a link to a help desk. it is a link to a document explaining how to ask questions the smart way.
<a name="Versions"></a>
<h2>On Which versions is this plugin tested?</h2>
The plugin is tested on Arduino 0023 and Arduino 1.0.<br>
Note: not all versions are tested on all platforms.
<a name="platforms"></a>
<h2>On which platforms is this plugin tested?</h2>
The plugin is tested on Windows 7 Windows XP and Opensuse.<br>
Note: not all versions are tested on all platforms.

<h1>Arduino IDE Versus The arduino Plugin</h1>
<a name="why"></a>
<h2>Why would I want to use this plugin</h2>
This plugin is not meant to replace the Arduino IDE. I think the Arduino IDE is the place to get started with Arduino, no matter what is your background.
However when you are growing in writing code, or when you come from a software development background you will feel restrained by the Arduino IDE. In that case the eclipse plugin may be an alternative.
<a name="benefitIDE"></a>
<h2>What is the benefit of the Arduino IDE to the eclipse plugin</h2>
The Arduino IDE does a great job in introducing people to Arduino. This is so for hardware people writing their first C++ code and for software developers
doing their first electronics experience. So if you are new to Arduino stop
reading and learn to use the Arduino IDE.

The Arduino IDE does this by “hiding” C++ code complexity and Hardware complexity.

The hardware complexity is hidden in the libraries/compiler/winAVR which are also used by the eclipse plugin.
So there is no “real” difference there.

The plugin currently (?) does not hide the C++ code complexity.
For someone used to develop C/C++ this will not be a problem. People not used
to writing C++ will need to learn about 

<ul  type=disc>
 <li >Function declarations</li>
 <li >Using Include files</li>
 <li >The usage of extern</li>
</ul>

This because the way the Arduino IDE is set up it hides or avoids the need of these
functionalities. There are plenty of good C/C++ documents on the web that
explain these things, so I won't. 

<a name="benefitArduino"></a>
<h2>What is the benefit of the eclipse plugin to the Arduino IDE?</h2>
With the eclipse plugin you have a environment that is fully focused on the development of source code. It
provides plenty of features. The ones I like the most are: 

<ul  type=disc>
 <li > context sensitive coloring (read the
     color of the text changes because it is code or non active code or comment
     or ..) </li>
 <li > Immediate documentation (When
     you hover over a function you get the documentation of the function or
     even the implementation)</li>
 <li > Link through (ctrl clicking on
     a method sends you to the implementation of definition of the method)</li>
 <li >Auto complete (pressing CTRL
     space when typing a name you get a list of “known names” that start with
     these letters)</li>
</ul>

So there are plenty of good things a software developer misses in the Arduino IDE that
the rest of the world doesn't know about.

<a name="develop"></a>
<h2>What do I need to know to develop code for Arduino with this plugin?</h2>
After you
have read the pro and con's question you may wonder “how much is there to learn
before I get this plugin to work?"<br>

There is good news and there is bad news. 

The good
news is: Other people got it to work relatively quickly so why would you not be
able to do it. The eclipse plugin (just like the Arduino
IDE) hides AVR-C++ and avrDude<br>

The bad
news is that to get the full benefit you will have to understand more of C/C++
development; eclipse and CDT. Eclipse is a professional development environment
and that brings some complexity. But you don't have to understand it all before
you get your first programs running.<br>

<h1>Trouble shooting</h1>

<a name="doesntwork"></a>
<h2>The plugin doesn't work on my system.</h2>
First of all the plugin only works on a limited amount of platforms. See the faq for which versions. If you do not use any of these
operating systems you are out of luck for this plugin.
Secondly <br>
If it doesn't work with the IDE it won't work with the plugin.

Thirdly<br>
there are plenty of settings that can be wrong. If it doesn''t work for you
install the Arduino IDE in a new folder; install eclipse in a new folder; use a
new workspace and install the plugin. When doing so
make sure you do not uses spaces in any names. <br>

This way it should work.

<a name="spaces"></a>
<h2>Can I use spaces?</h2>
The usage of spaces is known to give problems when used in<br>

<ul  type=disc>
 <li >The Arduino Path.</li>
 <li >Project Names.</li>
</ul>

<a name="bugs"></a>
<h2>Eclipse tells me there are bugs in my code but it compiles ok.</h2>
Eclipse compiles you code in 2 ways. Once when you request a build (when
you press on the hammer) and ones when you change code (save a file). The
compiler is responsible for the build and the indexer is responsible for the continuous
build.<br>

The bugs
(the red animals in the code) you see in the code can be found by any of the 2.
The indexer behaves weird and sometimes doesn't find declarations that it
knows. In that case you have the bug without a bug (in other words the code compiles ok).<br>

Setting the
option windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;C/C++-&gt;indexer-&gt;index unused headers
seems to have fixed the issue on my system.<br>

<a name="elf"></a>
<h2>Where is the elf file?</h2>
When you have compiled the sketch sometimes you can not see the elf file in eclipse. <br>

This is a bug related to eclipse. If your project compiled fine refresh the project (pres F5 when you have the project selected).<br>
Now there should e a binaries folder in the root of your project containing the elf file.

<a name="errors"></a>
<h2>There are errors and warnings in the Arduino library.</h2>
But it compiles OK.<br>
in Arduino 1.0 there is only one warning left.<br>
The file WString.cpp gives an error with the eclipse indexer. This
is actually an error in the file

See this <a href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,69820.msg517336.html#msg517336">post</a>
for more info<br>
HardwareSerial.h: I am not sure what is the problem here<br>
pins_arduino.c: contains clearly warnings that can be fixed by adding a cast <br>
Print.cpp: contains a warning that can be fixed by adding a cast<br>
Tone.cpp: contains warnings because the eclipse C/C++ indexer goes weird<br>
Basically there is nothing to worry about, but it would be better if it were cleaned up.<br>

<a name="modified"></a>
<h2>I have modified my Arduino setup and... </h2>
You are entitled to modify the Arduino IDE setup. But I'm not supporting this. If you know what you have been doing and you play a bit
with eclipse you will find many ways to help you to solve your problem.

<br>To be frank: If you can change the Arduino IDE setup you are a big boy so you can deal with
it, write a document about it and share it with the world.<br>
This way we all become smarter.<br>

<a name="canceled"></a>
<h2>I can not cancel the upload to the Arduino Board</h2>
Someone reported that pressing the cancel button during upload to arduino locks the com port.  Even if the upload is not working.  To solve the lock unplug the arduino from your pc and replug.<br>
