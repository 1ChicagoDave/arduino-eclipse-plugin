      This add a serial monitor to the Arduino eclipse plugin.
This monitor does not reset the arduino by default.
This monitor auto deconnects when you do a upload and reconnects (without resetting) when the upload is done.
This monitor has a reset button so you can reset your board without leaving the monitor
This monitor supports up to 3 serial ports at the same time (different color for each port)
This monitor supports CR/LF/CR+LF and none like the arduino monitor
This monitor supports deleting part of the text but no other editing is supported (backspace and delete only)
You can not select the colors used by the monitor
You can not send the same string to multiple boards at the same time automatically.
You can not open more than one serial monitor in a eclipse instance
